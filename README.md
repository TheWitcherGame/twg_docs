> About The Witcher Game.

Being based on a novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski – a bestselling Polish author – gives the game’s universe and characters
credibility, authority and exceptional cohesiveness. In this harsh fantasy world abstract, absolute and unconditional ideas such as “Good” and “Evil” written in upper case letters do not exist.

Instead, however, while moral good exists, the protagonist will often only have a choice between two evils, deciding on the path which he regards as the lesser evil of the two.

The story begins with Geralt reappearing after being feared dead. He is found unconscious, dazed and with only a vague recollection of past events. This way, players unfamiliar with Sapkowski’s works will be able to gradually immerse into the fantasy realm. The game
features an innovative, time delayed decision-consequence system, prodding players to make their decisions seriously and with
thought.

The whole world does not revolve just around Geralt. NPCs will lead their lives independently of the protagonist, yet upon
interaction they can be influenced by and react to the Witcher’s actions.
It’s basically a living world, of which Geralt is only a part of, despite his involvement in its ultimate fate.
